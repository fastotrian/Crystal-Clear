        <p id="subhead">Water pollution occurs when harmful substances often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment Water pollution can have severe consequences for both human health and the environment. Contaminated water sources can lead to the spread of diseases, disrupt aquatic ecosystems, and harm wildlife. Pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, industrial chemicals, and untreated sewage can accumulate in water bodies, leading to long-term environmental damage. This pollution not only</p>

        <p id="causesp">One of the primary causes of water pollution is the contamination of water bodies by toxic chemicals. As seen in the example mentioned above, the dumped plastic bottles, tins, water cans and other wastes pollute the water bodies. These result in water pollution, which harms not just humans, but the whole ecosystem. Toxins drained from these pollutants, travel up to the food chain and eventually affect humans. In most cases, the outcome is destructive to only the local population and species, but it can have an impact on a global scale too.</p>

        <p id="effectsp">Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks. This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking.</p>

        <img  id="solutiong" src="mPfOTj1_gif (896×473) (2).gif">
        <p id="solutionp">The water pollution problem can be addressed through ten key solutions. First, wastewater treatment is essential to reduce pollutants entering water bodies. Reducing plastic waste and conserving water are also critical steps to minimize pollution. The use of water-saving toilets and proper septic tank maintenance can further decrease water contamination. It's important to avoid using toilets as garbage bins, as this prevents unnecessary waste from entering the water system. Rainwater management and promoting green agriculture and wetlands help naturally filter pollutants. Additionally, denitrification processes can reduce harmful nitrogen compounds, and ozone wastewater treatment can effectively disinfect and purify water.</p>
